* Introduction
Auto Deployment Service(ADS) is one of the Node in Base-1 cluster,
which is responsible for deploying and testing the labs.  The detail
description of each Node in the cluster can be referenced in the
Base-1 cluster document. This document describes the roles, services
and various adapters of the ADS.

This Network diagram represents the structure of ADS in the Base-1
Cluster.  The prerequisite for the ADS is to ensure that all other
nodes in the Network are setup.

* ADS as plug and play
ADS can work independent to deploy and test the labs. It can also
integrate with Base-1 cluster and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the
current release, ADS integrates with Base-1 cluster.

** Role of ADS
Auto Deployment Service(ADS) is a service used by a lab integrator to
deploy and test the lab. 

The infrastructure, where labs are hosted is secured by enabling
various services through [[./playbook-structure.org][ansible playbook]]. Once the network is up, the
next task is to deploy the labs. 

** ADS and Adapters
Types of Adapters are as follows:
- *CentOSVZAdapter:* A module for managing VMs on CentOS OpenVZ platform.
- *AWSAdapter:* A module for managing VMs on Amazon.
- *DummyAdapter:* A module which is a mock adapter. It pretends to setup VM's and the like but actually does nothing.
In the current release, CentOSVZAdapter is used for setting of ADS for Base-1 cluster.
